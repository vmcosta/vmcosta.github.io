s:2122:"<p>Grav is very easy to install. Because it does not require a database, installation can be as simple as unzipping the Grav core (or a skeleton) in the server directory you wish to have your Grav install appear.</p>
<p>Pretty much the only real requirement of Grav is that your server is running PHP 5.4 or higher. You can use Grav with Apache, Nginx, LiteSpeed, IIS, etc.</p>

<h2>Option 1: Install with ZIP package</h2>
<p>The easiest way to install Grav is to use the ZIP package and install it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the latest-and-greatest Grav Base package from the <a href="http://getgrav.org/downloads">Downloads</a> page.</li>
<li>Extract the ZIP file in your webroot of your web server, e.g. <code>~/webroot/grav</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you downloaded the ZIP file and then plan to move it to your webroot, please move the <strong>entire folder</strong> because it contains several hidden files (such as <code>.htaccess</code>) that will not be selected by default. The omission of these hidden files can cause problems when running Grav.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Option 2: Install from GitHub</h2>
<p>The alternative method is to install Grav from the GitHub repository and then run a simple dependency installation script:</p>
<p>Clone the Grav repository from GitHub to a folder in the webroot of your server, e.g. <code>~/webroot/grav</code>. Launch a <code>Terminal</code> or <code>Command Line</code> and navigate to the webroot folder:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cd ~/webroot
$ git clone https://github.com/getgrav/grav.git</code></pre>
<p>Install the <strong>plugin</strong> and theme <strong>dependencies</strong> by using the <a href="http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-cli">Grav CLI application</a> <code>bin/grav</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cd ~/webroot/grav
$ bin/grav install
This will automatically clone the required dependencies from GitHub directly into this Grav installation.</code></pre>
